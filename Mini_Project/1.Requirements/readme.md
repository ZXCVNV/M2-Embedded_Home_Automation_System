## INTRODUCTION
In this era of digital revolution, we are surrounded by smart devices that are capable of making decisions on their own without much human intervention. Our home can also be made smart by implementing a real-time home automation system that monitors parameters like power consumption and human presence. Home automation may include centralised control of electrical devices including lightings, appliances and security.
## IDENTIFYING FEATURES
This system consists of closely-networked Atmel’s ATmega8, which is an AVR based microcontroller with 512 bytes EEPROM on a 28-pin DIP package, 1024 bytes internal SRAM and 8kB internal flash memory. The complete system is assembled in a small, portable central processing unit (CPU) chassis for an aesthetic look and uninterrupted 24×7 usage.
## STATE OF ART
Here is a touch-control based home automation system that can control up to six electrical devices. It also has a separate keyboard interface module for troubleshooting and system settings.
## 4W AND 1H
## WHERE
The home automation systems are used for controlling the indoor & outdoor lights, heat, ventilation, air conditioning in the house, to lock or open the doors & gates, to control electrical & electronic appliances and so on using various control systems with appropriate sensors.
## WHAT
A home automation system is a technological solution that enables automating the bulk of electronic, electrical and technology-based tasks within a home. It uses a combination of hardware and software technologies that enable control and management over appliances and devices within a home.
## WHY
With smart home devices, you can remotely monitor your home appliances and ensure that all devices are safely switched off. One of the biggest advantages of home automation is that it keeps your abode safe, and prevents accidental fires, water leaks, gas leaks, and other disasters.
## WHEN
In 1975, a Scottish company named Pico Electronics launched the first home automation technology – the X10. Still in use today, it enabled people to control various items in their households.
